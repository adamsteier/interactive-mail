This is creating ONLY THE IMAGE ELEMENT of a postcard based on limited information:
- The image must have a clear, single focal point featuring ${imagePrimarySubject || 'a smiling person'}.  
- The image should appeal to ${targetDescription || 'business professionals'}
- Use a color palette that complements ${colors.primary} and ${colors.accent}
- The style should be ${brandAesthetic}
- Layout style: ${layoutStyle}

Important visual requirements:
- The image should be filling the entire space, no borders, no badges, no paper, no framing, no background elements.
- This is NOT a complete postcard design - create ONLY the image element
- Create a visually clean image that isn't overly complex
- The focal point should be prominent and immediately recognizable
- The image should look professional, polished, and suitable as part of a direct mail postcard
- No text or logos in the image
- The image should take up the entire canvas, no badges, paper
- The composition should be balanced but not too busy or cluttered
- Create an image that would work well when integrated into a postcard layout (5.5"Ã—3.5")`;
