# Interactive Mail Application Overview

This document provides an overview of the Interactive Mail application, explaining the main components and how they work together to create targeted marketing campaigns and postcards.

## Core Application Flow

### 1. Home Page (src/app/page.tsx)

The home page is the main entry point for users and serves as a wizard-like interface that guides users through the process of creating targeted marketing campaigns. The workflow includes:

1. **Location Selection**: The application starts by fetching the user's location data automatically or allowing manual input of a target area.
2. **Business Information Collection**: Users input their business name and other basic information.
3. **Business Analysis**: The application analyzes the business information to determine the industry and provides a description.
4. **Marketing Strategy Generation**: Based on the business analysis, the app generates a tailored marketing strategy.
5. **Leads Collection**: The app searches for potential business leads in the specified target area.
6. **Authentication**: When users try to view their leads, they're prompted to sign in or create an account while data processing continues in the background.

#### Key Components on Home Page:
- `AnimatedBackground`: Provides an interactive background that reacts to user input
- `TypewriterPrompt`: Displays step instructions with a typewriter animation effect
- `InputField`: Captures user input for each step
- `InfoBox`: Displays submitted information in organized info boxes
- `LoadingBar`: Shows loading state while processing data
- `EditModal`: Allows users to edit previously entered information
- `MarketingResults`: Displays the generated marketing strategy and business targets
- `PlacesLeadsCollection`: Shows potential business leads in the target area
- `LocationSelector`: Allows users to select specific locations
- `TechnoConfetti`: Celebratory animation displayed when analysis is complete
- `AuthOverlay`: Displays authentication options when users try to access premium features

#### Marketing Results Component (src/components/MarketingResults.tsx)
The Marketing Results component presents the generated marketing strategy to the user, including:
- Primary recommendation for their business
- Business targets that could be potential customers
- Checkboxes to select which business types to target
- Action buttons to start searching for leads based on selected business types

When the user selects business types and initiates the search:
1. The component updates the search results state in the store
2. Updates the business analysis with the bounding box information
3. Triggers the Google search for businesses in the target area
4. Transitions to showing the leads collection interface

#### Places Leads Collection Component (src/components/PlacesLeadsCollection.tsx)
This component handles the display and management of business leads found in the target area:
- Displays a list of potential leads with business details
- Provides filtering options by business type
- Enables selection of leads (individual, bulk, or shift-select for ranges)
- Shows a summary of selected leads
- Includes actions to export or save leads for follow-up

The component smartly manages lead data by:
- Filtering leads based on business type
- Tracking selected leads with an efficient Set data structure
- Supporting advanced selection patterns (range selection with shift key)
- Displaying progress indicators during the search process

### 2. Postcard Design (src/app/design/page.tsx)

After analyzing the target market, users can create custom postcards for their marketing campaigns.

#### Key Components:
- `PostcardDesigner`: Main component that handles the postcard design process, offering three design methods:
  - Upload existing designs
  - AI-generated designs
  - Work with a human designer

The AI design flow is managed by `AIDesignWizard` which guides users through several steps:

1. **Design Method Selection**: Choose between single design or multiple segment-based designs
2. **Audience Segmentation**: Identify different audience segments if applicable
3. **Brand Identity**: Enter brand information like colors, style preferences, and logo
4. **Marketing Goals**: Define marketing objectives and call-to-action
5. **Target Audience**: Specify audience demographics and interests
6. **Business Details**: Input business contact information and taglines
7. **Visual Elements**: Select design style, layout, and image preferences
8. **Review & Generate**: Confirm details and generate the postcard design

### 3. Postcard Preview (src/app/postcard_preview/page.tsx)

Users can view all their saved postcard designs, which are stored in Firebase.

#### Key Components:
- `PostcardPreviewPage`: Main component that fetches and displays saved postcard designs
- `DynamicPostcard`: Renders individual postcards using stored code
- `ZoomablePostcard`: Allows users to zoom and examine postcard details

The `DynamicPostcard` component uses an innovative approach to render postcards:
- It loads postcard designs as code strings from Firebase

## User Experience Flow

1. User starts at the home page and enters their target area
2. User enters their business name
3. The system analyzes the business and generates a marketing strategy
4. User reviews the strategy and selects which business types to target
5. When the user clicks "Looks good, now show me my leads", the authentication overlay appears if the user is not logged in
6. The system continues processing data in the background while the user signs in or creates an account
7. Once authenticated, the overlay closes and the user can see their leads
8. The system searches for leads matching the selected business types in the target area
9. User can select leads of interest and export or save them for future marketing efforts
10. User can navigate to the postcard designer to create marketing materials
11. In the postcard designer, user can choose a design method (AI is the most sophisticated option)
12. If using AI, the wizard guides user through various steps to collect necessary information:
   - Design Method (single or multiple designs)
   - Audience Segmentation (if multiple designs selected)
   - Brand Identity (colors, style preferences, logo)
   - Marketing Goals (objectives, call to action)
   - Target Audience (industry, description)
