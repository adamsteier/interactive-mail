# Todo - April 5th, 2024

This file outlines the development tasks for the interactive postcard generator project.

## Core Task Breakdown:

### 1. Admin Dashboard for Image Moderation & Upload
   - [ ] Design UI/UX for the Admin Dashboard.
   - [ ] Implement Admin Authentication/Authorization (e.g., separate login, role-based access).
   - [ ] Create Firestore listeners/queries to display pending user generation requests (prompt, logo, colors, etc.).
   - [ ] Build UI component to show user-provided details and the generated prompt.
   - [ ] Integrate button/action for Admin to trigger image generation using the prepared data.
   - [ ] Display generated images received from the generation service.
   - [ ] Implement image upload functionality for Admin to upload the approved/edited image back to the system (e.g., to Firestore Storage).
   - [ ] Update Firestore document for the user's session/request with the uploaded image URL and status (e.g., 'approved').
   - [ ] **(Optional/Stretch)** Implement a basic live chat feature between Admin and User (consider Firestore real-time updates or a dedicated service).

### 2. Secure Firestore Rules
   - [ ] Define rules allowing anonymous users read/write access ONLY to their specific session data (e.g., `/sessions/{anonUserId}`).
   - [ ] Define rules allowing authenticated users read/write access ONLY to their own data (e.g., `/users/{userId}`).
   - [ ] Implement logic (Cloud Function or client-side) to migrate/link data from an anonymous session to an authenticated user upon sign-up/login.
   - [ ] Define rules for Admin role granting necessary access (e.g., read access to relevant user data, write access to specific fields like image approval status/URL).
   - [ ] Write and deploy Firestore security rules.
   - [ ] Test rules thoroughly using the Firestore emulator or manual testing.

### 3. Ensure Full Data Persistence to Firestore
   - [ ] Review `PostcardGeneration.tsx` and other relevant components.
   - [ ] Verify that ALL form inputs (Brand, Marketing, Audience, Business, Visual data) are being saved to the user's session document in Firestore.
   - [ ] Ensure generated `prompt`, `imageIds`, `templateStyle`, `creativityLevel`, `selectedImageIndex`, `imagePosition`, and final postcard design details are saved.
   - [ ] Implement logic to fetch this saved data when a user resumes a session or logs back in.
   - [ ] Ensure data is correctly associated with the user (anonymous or authenticated).

### 4. Improve User Dashboard
   - [ ] Define specific improvements (e.g., view past postcard designs/orders, manage account, update payment info).
   - [ ] Design UI/UX for the improved dashboard sections.
   - [ ] Implement React components for the new dashboard features.
   - [ ] Add necessary Firestore queries to fetch user-specific data (past orders, account details).

### 5. Improve Admin Dashboard (Beyond Initial Build)
   - [ ] Define specific improvements (e.g., user management list, view user details, analytics on generations/orders, system configuration).
   - [ ] Design UI/UX for these additional admin features.
   - [ ] Implement the corresponding components and Firestore queries/functions.

### 6. Stripe Integration (Payment Processing)
   - [ ] Create a Stripe account and get API keys (test and live).
   - [ ] Install Stripe Node.js library (`stripe`) for backend and Stripe.js (`@stripe/stripe-js`, `@stripe/react-stripe-js`) for frontend.
   - [ ] Create backend Cloud Functions or endpoints for:
     - [ ] Creating Stripe Customers.
     - [ ] Creating Stripe Payment Intents or Checkout Sessions.
     - [ ] Handling Stripe Webhooks (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`, `checkout.session.completed`).
   - [ ] Integrate Stripe Elements or Stripe Checkout into the frontend payment flow.
   - [ ] Securely handle API keys (use environment variables/Firebase config).
   - [ ] Update Firestore order documents with payment status based on webhook events.

### 7. Payment System Logic
   - [ ] Define pricing structure (e.g., per postcard, bulk discounts, subscription tiers?).
   - [ ] Integrate payment steps into the user flow (e.g., after design approval, before sending).
   - [ ] Display pricing clearly in the UI.
   - [ ] Implement logic to check for successful payment before proceeding to the sending step.

### 8. Stannp API Integration (Postcard Sending)
   - [ ] Research Stannp API documentation (https://www.stannp.com/uk/direct-mail-api or similar). Look for endpoints related to creating campaigns/sending postcards.
   - [ ] Sign up for a Stannp account and obtain API credentials.
   - [ ] Create backend Cloud Functions or endpoints to:
     - [ ] Format postcard data (approved image URL, recipient address - needs adding to user flow/data model).
     - [ ] Make authenticated requests to the Stannp API to trigger postcard sending.
   - [ ] Handle Stannp API responses (success, failure, tracking info if available).
   - [ ] Update Firestore order documents with sending status (e.g., 'sent', 'failed', Stannp job ID).
   - [ ] Add UI elements/forms for users to input recipient addresses.
   - [ ] Securely handle Stannp API keys.

### 9. AI Design + Expert Review Flow (Detailed Steps)
   - **Frontend (`PostcardDesigner.tsx`):**
     - [x] Add a fourth design option: "AI Design + Expert Review".
     - [x] Update `handleContinue` to trigger the new `HumanAssistedWizard` for this option.
   - **Frontend (New Component: `HumanAssistedWizard.tsx`):**
     - [x] Create a new wizard component, potentially reusing elements from `AIDesignWizard`.
     - [x] Include all necessary data collection steps (Brand, Marketing, Audience, etc.).
     - [x] **Crucially:** Add a step for required logo file upload (using Firebase Storage).
     - [x] On submit, gather all user data and the uploaded logo URL(s).
     - [ ] **(Refinement)** Implement actual Firebase Storage logo upload in `handleUploadLogo`.
     - [ ] **(Refinement)** Implement the final `handleSubmitRequest` to:
       - [ ] Write initial data (`userInputData`, `logoUrl`, `status: 'pending_prompt'`) to Firestore `design_requests` collection.
       - [ ] Call the `/api/generate-design-prompt` API route, passing necessary data or the document ID.
       - [ ] Handle response from the API route (show success/error).
   - **Backend (API Route - `/api/generate-design-prompt/route.ts`):**
     - [ ] **(New Task)** Create the API route file.
     - [ ] Define expected `POST` request body (e.g., `{ documentId: string }` or full data).
     - [ ] Implement `POST` handler:
       - [ ] Parse request body.
       - [ ] (If needed) Fetch full request data from Firestore using the ID.
       - [ ] Call OpenAI API (`gpt-4o-latest`) using user data/logo URL to get prompt & summary.
       - [ ] Update Firestore `design_requests` document with `aiGeneratedPrompt`, `aiSummary`, and `status: 'pending_review'`.
       - [ ] **(Integrate Task #10)** Call SendGrid API to notify admin (see details in Task #10).
       - [ ] **(Integrate Task #10)** Update Firestore document with `notifiedAdmin: true`.
       - [ ] Return success/failure `NextResponse`.
   - **Firestore (New Collection: `design_requests`):**
     - [ ] Define schema: `userId` (or other identifier), `status` (e.g., `pending_prompt`, `pending_review`, `completed`, `failed`), `userInputData` (object containing brand, marketing, etc.), `logoUrl`, `aiGeneratedPrompt` (optional), `aiSummary` (optional), `finalImageUrls` (array, optional), `createdAt`, `completedAt` (optional), `notifiedAdmin` (boolean, optional).
     - [ ] Secure this collection with appropriate Firestore Rules (user reads own, admin reads all/updates status/images, API route backend needs write access).
   - **Admin Dashboard (Task #1 Integration):**
     - [ ] Create a view/section to list `design_requests` where `status == 'pending_review'`.
     - [ ] Display `aiGeneratedPrompt`, `aiSummary`, and provide links/previews for `logoUrl`.
     - [ ] Implement UI for admin to manually trigger external image generation (this is an external step for the admin).
     - [ ] Implement UI for admin to upload the resulting generated images (to Firebase Storage).
     - [ ] Add button/action for admin to mark the request as `completed` and save the `finalImageUrls` to the Firestore document.
   - **Frontend (User Results Display):**
     - [ ] Implement a mechanism (e.g., Firestore listener or polling after API call success) for the user app to monitor their specific `design_requests` document.
     - [ ] Create a UI view to inform the user their request is processing ("Generating prompt...", "Waiting for review...").
     - [ ] When `status == 'completed'`, fetch `finalImageUrls`.
     - [ ] Display the admin-uploaded images to the user.
     - [ ] Update user flow to proceed from here (e.g., to payment/sending).

### 10. SendGrid Integration for Admin Notification (Now part of API Route)
   - [ ] Install SendGrid Node.js library (`@sendgrid/mail`).
   - [ ] **(Integrated into API Route)** Function Logic:
     - [ ] Read necessary data (`aiGeneratedPrompt`, `aiSummary`, `logoUrl`, user info if needed) within the API route.
     - [ ] Construct an email notification for the admin (e.g., to `adam@posttimely.com`).
     - [ ] Include key details and a link to the admin dashboard/specific request.
     - [ ] Use the SendGrid API key (from environment config) and `@sendgrid/mail` to send the email *after* successful AI call and Firestore update.
     - [ ] Update the `design_requests` document to set `notifiedAdmin` to `true` after sending.
   - [ ] Configure SendGrid API key securely in environment variables (already done in `.env.local`).
   - [ ] Ensure Firebase Admin SDK is set up for server-side Firestore access in the API route.
