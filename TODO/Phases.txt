## 🔄 **Storage Architecture Update (User-First Structure)**

### **Completed Migration to User-First Storage**
All V2 storage paths have been updated to follow a consistent user-first structure:

```
OLD: /v2/campaigns/{campaignId}/...
NEW: /v2/{userId}/campaigns/{campaignId}/...

OLD: /v2/brands/{userId}/logos/{brandId}/...
NEW: /v2/{userId}/brands/{brandId}/logos/...
```

### **Benefits Achieved**
- ✅ **Simplified Security Rules**: One rule covers all user content
- ✅ **Consistent Structure**: Everything under `/v2/{userId}/`
- ✅ **Anonymous User Support**: Works seamlessly with Firebase anonymous auth
- ✅ **Easy User Management**: All user data in one location
- ✅ **GDPR Compliant**: Simple data export/deletion per user

### **Implementation Complete**
- ✅ Updated `brandService.ts` to use new paths
- ✅ Updated `imageProcessingService.ts` with userId parameters
- ✅ Updated `campaignProcessingService.ts` to pass userId through
- ✅ Updated Firebase Storage rules to user-first structure
- ✅ Deployed simplified security rules

## 🔐 **Anonymous Authentication & Account Linking Strategy**

### **Core Principle**: Anonymous Users Are Authenticated Users
- **Anonymous users are legitimate Firebase Auth users** (not fake IDs)
- All Firebase Auth functionality (including anonymous) works throughout the system
- Campaign creation requires Firebase Auth (anonymous users supported)
- Account linking preserves all anonymous user data and campaigns

### **Account Linking Requirements**
**CRITICAL**: Every point where a user might create an account needs to properly link to the anonymous Firebase Auth account using `linkWithCredential` functionality.

#### **Mandatory Account Linking Points**:
1. **Payment Time** (Required):
   - Users MUST create account to complete payment
   - Use `linkWithCredential` to preserve anonymous campaigns
   - All payment processing requires authenticated account

2. **Email Capture** (Optional):
   - Collect email for guest users before checkout
   - Use `linkWithCredential` if user decides to create account
   - Preserve campaign data during account linking

3. **Any Account Creation Flow**:
   - Sign up forms throughout the app
   - Social login (Google, etc.)
   - Email/password registration
   - All must use `linkWithCredential` for anonymous users

#### **Implementation Notes**:
- `AuthContext` already has `linkWithCredential` functionality implemented
- Anonymous users maintain their campaigns when linking accounts
- Campaign ownership transfers properly from anonymous to authenticated
- All account creation flows must check `isAnonymous` state before proceeding

#### **Authentication Flow Fixed**:
- ✅ Cloud Function updated to require Firebase Auth (including anonymous)
- ✅ Frontend updated to ensure anonymous auth completes before campaign creation
- ✅ Better error handling for authentication failures
- ✅ Campaign creation now works for anonymous users
