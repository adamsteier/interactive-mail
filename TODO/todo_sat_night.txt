## NOTES

- Current implementation follows pattern similar to AIDesignWizard but needs rethinking for direct subcollection access
- Admin page should be updated to read directly from user's campaignDesigns subcollection instead of a separate design_requests collection
- Consider adding metadata and grouping fields to campaignDesigns documents to facilitate admin processing
- May need to implement querying/aggregation logic in admin page to group related campaign designs

## NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

1. Implement multi-select components for tone and visualStyle
2. Enhance campaignDesigns documents with additional metadata for admin use
3. Add admin notification logic to campaignDesigns documents
4. Update admin page to read from and process campaignDesigns subcollection
