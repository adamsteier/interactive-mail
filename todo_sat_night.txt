- ✅ Basic CampaignDesignData storage structure
- ✅ Campaign data submission to Firestore subcollections
- ✅ Navigation between steps

## ❌ TODO ITEMS

- ❌ Implement multi-select components for tone and visualStyle fields
  - Need proper UI components for selecting from predefined options
  - Consider dropdown or tag-based selection components

- ❌ Create design_requests document in Firestore
  - Currently only writing to user's campaignDesigns subcollection
  - Need to create main document that admin will access

- ❌ Notify admin when new design request is submitted
  - Add notification field in Firestore document
  - Consider email notification or in-app alert system

- ❌ Update admin request viewing page to handle new format
  - Ensure compatibility with current structure
  - Add support for tone/visualStyle fields display

- ❌ AI processing integration
  - Connect to AI service for generating initial concepts
  - Handle AI response storage

- ❌ Complete handleSubmit function:
  - Map CampaignDesignData to format expected by admin page
  - Include all required fields:
    - userId
    - status (initially "pending_prompt")
    - designScope
    - globalBrandData
    - campaigns array with proper structure
    - logoUrl
    - createdAt timestamp
    - notifiedAdmin flag

- ❌ Success/failure messaging after submission
  - Show clear success message with next steps
  - Proper error handling and user feedback

- ❌ Loading states and error states throughout the wizard
  - Add spinners/loading indicators where appropriate
  - Better error messaging for API calls

- ❌ Mobile responsiveness improvements
  - Test and fix responsive layout issues
  - Ensure forms work well on small screens

## NOTES

- Current implementation follows pattern similar to AIDesignWizard but needs to be aligned with HumanAssistedWizard
- Admin page expects specific document structure in design_requests collection
- Need to match the data structure shown in admin/requests/[id]/page.tsx
- Consider reusing logic from HumanAssistedWizard.tsx for admin notification and document structure

## NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

1. Implement multi-select components for tone and visualStyle
2. Complete handleSubmit function to create proper design_requests document
3. Add admin notification logic
4. Test end-to-end flow with admin review page
