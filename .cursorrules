This is built using Next.js 15

In Next.js 15+ route handlers ([param]/route.ts), params must be handled as Promises:

typescript
type Params = Promise<{ paramName: string }>;
export async function GET(
request: Request,
{ params }: { params: Params }
) {
const { paramName } = await params;
// Use paramName
}

Don't run npm run dev at the end of a chat.  If I want to run npm run dev or build I will do it myself
